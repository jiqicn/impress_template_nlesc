# impress_template_nlesc
Template of impress.js for creating slides that follows the communication standards of NLeSC.

This template is based on the [official demo](https://impress.js.org/#/bored) of impress.js, with motifications (e.g. adding fonts, logos, background images, etc.) to make it easier to be used at NLeSC. 

The live demo can be found [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jiqicn/impress_template_nlesc/blob/main/index.html#/title).
